Food for All is an application developed in December of 2021.  The purpose behind it is to give people better options for cooking in a way that saves time, money, and space.  The idea is to give users extensive search options to narrow down the results they get when looking for a particular idea.  This concept applies to people trying to follow certain dietary criteria for general health, weight-loss, religious reasons, looking to avoid foods they are allergic to, or simply want to try different types of recipes they normally can't find.  They are plenty of options available to find recipes, we look to make it easier to find recipes that work for you.
